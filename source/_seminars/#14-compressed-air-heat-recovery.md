Around 10% of all electricity used in industry is accounted for by compressed air systems; more than 90% of this energy is converted to heat, which wasted to the atmosphere through the system’s motor and cooling system, with the majority lost through the compressor’s oil cooler. Recovering this heat can prove invaluable for businesses looking to make efficiency gains. The presentation will look at the various ways heat recovery can be achieved and how to choose the best method for your facility.
