**About BEKO**

BEKO TECHNOLOGIES develops, manufactures and sells components and systems worldwide for an optimised compressed air quality. With an extensive program the company stands for compressed air technology "at its best"​.

For more than three decades, we have represented worldwide tried and tested compressed air and compressed gas technologies. Our products, systems and solutions ensure the required quality that our customers demand for their production processes – safely and energy-efficient. For quality made in Germany. And for values made by BEKO TECHNOLOGIES.

**BEKO TECHNOLOGIES – Better through responsibility**

We live from our family-oriented values and stand for humanity and mutual respect. This claim makes our products, systems and services even better. As an independent developer and production company we ensure, and are responsible for, individual solutions that make our customers' production processes more energy efficient. Operational and occupational safety, environmental friendliness and the contribution to humane working conditions represent a better, more holistic solution.

The compressed air supply for our end customers is improved by our products and systems for compressed air treatment and processing, combined with our know-how. Plant and system manufacturers have been relying on our products for many years, because this makes their plants and systems better.
