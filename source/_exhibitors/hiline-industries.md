Hi-line industries are renowned in the compressed air industry as innovative designers and manufacturers of energy efficient air treatment products.  Focus is centred on “cost of ownership” over a long and reliable energy efficient life time. 

Typically purchase cost of a piece of air treatment equipment is only 15% of life time cost.  The vast bulk of the cost is energy; make sure that your purchase considers these lifetime costs.

As members of BCAS and sitting on various committees with a strong interest in designing and producing ‘low energy’ and ‘low carbon’ footprint products, Hi-lines mission is to produce air treatment products with the lowest possible cost of ownership over its life cycle.  With a strong team of highly qualified technicians to service, maintain and support all products.  Hi-line Industries are the ‘agenda setters’ in this industry sector.
